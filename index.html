      <h2>Hi,Everyone!</h2>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          My name is Ali Nazari. I am a motivated Computer Science student with
          a strong interest in backend development and building practical,
          real-world solutions. I have a solid foundation in Python and web
          fundamentals, including HTML and CSS, and I focus on writing clean,
          structured, and maintainable code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside my studies, I balance work responsibilities, which has
          helped me develop discipline, time management, and a strong work
          ethic. I enjoy learning by building projects and continuously
          improving my skills through hands-on practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to grow as a backend developer, work with modern
          technologies, and contribute to meaningful projects that solve real
          problems. I am committed to consistent learning and professional
          growth.
